# Final Project: Austin Pandemic Crime

## Reason for Selecting this Topic
When trying to decide what type of data to use for our final project, we determined that we all had an interest in crime data.  In addition, we wanted to analyze recent crime data and were curious as to how the pandemic affected crime in Austin, Texas.

## Data Source Description
The original data file for the Austin crime data can be found on Kaggle at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sdallman/austin-crime-report-200372021

The full data set includes city of Austin, Texas crime data from the year 2003 through July 2021.  We will focus on data from three distinct time periods:
Baseline: March 10, 2019 thru March 10, 2020
Pandemic Year: March 11, 2020 thru March 11, 2021
Post Pandemic: March 12, 2021 to July 2021

The original data file for the Austin Covid cases by zip code can be found at the following link:

This data set originates with the City of Austin as an Austin - Travis County Public Dataset where all numbers are provisional and subject to change.

## Questions to Explore
We want to answer the following questions: 
- Did all categories of crime increase during the pandemic year?  
- Did crime return to baseline after the pandemic year closed?
- Did zip codes in Austin with the highest number(s) of positive covid results see a resulting increase or decrease in the crime rate for that zip code?

##  Communication Protocol
- We will use Slack (group) direct message as our primary means of communication. 
- We will meet via Zoom, as needed and will be scheduled using Slack.
- We will reach out via Slack when we need assistance from our Team.
- In case of emergency, message the group on Slack.
